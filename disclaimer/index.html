        <p>The developers of this idea are young people full of energy who would not be able to spend their days vegetating in front of the TV, doing nothing productive. In order for the described society to work it’s necessary that the majority of the population has an equal or similar mindset. However, when you’re a motivated student you’re likely to hang around with fellows of the same age and attitude rather than with a middle aged welfare recipient. Therefore it’s quite impossible for the developers to imagine that a larger number of people spend their days doing nothing.
            So if you think there is a too large number of unmotivated people and the situation gets misjudged by the developers feel free to contact them here.
