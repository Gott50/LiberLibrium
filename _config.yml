  Imagine, if you could earn your living by following your passion. Indeed, this is possible with almost every hobby, but in modern forms of society it is unlikely that you are given this opportunity.
  Imagine how it would be, if you wouldn’t have to worry about your future or that of your loved ones.
  Imagine how it would be, if you wouldn’t have to work, but could evolve freely.
  Imagine how it would be, if you wouldn’t be limited by any social or financial circumstances.
