            <p><em>Imagine</em>, if you could earn your living by following your passion.
                Indeed, this is possible with almost every hobby, but in modern forms of society it is unlikely that you are given this opportunity.</p>
            <p><em>Imagine</em> how it would be, if you wouldn’t have to worry about your future or that of your loved ones.</p>
            <p><em>Imagine</em> how it would be, if you wouldn’t have to work, but could evolve freely.</p>
            <p><em>Imagine</em> how it would be, if you wouldn’t be limited by any social or financial circumstances.</p>

            <p><strong>The following concepts promise to solve the problems mentioned above and to ensure our fundamental rights.</strong></p>
